         <p class="b2">Netball is a fast-paced, exciting team sport that is played on a rectangular court. It involves two teams of seven players aiming to score goals by shooting a ball into the opposing team’s net. The sport is particularly popular among women and is played in over 70 countries worldwide.</p>
         <p class="b2">Developed in the late 19th century, netball emphasizes teamwork, strategy, and agility. It’s recognized as a sport that fosters community and inspires athletes of all levels.</p>

   <h2 class="b3">Netball History</h2>
   <p class="b2">
      In 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts, a 30-year-old Canadian immigrant to the USA, James Naismith, was ordered to invent an indoor game for high-spirited young men at the School for Christian Workers (later named the YMCA). 
      Most games ended with injury rates of staggering amounts, so Naismith conjured up a game whereby a ball had to be lobbed into a high basket because he thought that if a ball had to be dropped into the “goal,” it couldn’t be thrown at fast speeds.
      Basketball was born, with the original game featuring nine players – three forwards, three centers, and three guards – simply because Naismith had 18 youths to keep amused. 
      Women’s indoor basketball began exactly two days later when female teachers to the gym were captivated by the game, but it wasn’t until 1895 that the current game of netball was well and truly shaped. Netball was first played in 1895 in England at Madame Osterberg's College.
